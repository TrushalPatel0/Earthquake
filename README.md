## **Business Case-Study**

Earthquakes are natural disasters with the potential to cause widespread devastation, leading to loss of life, property damage, and disruption of
essential services. Traditional seismic design and retrofitting methods have limitations in predicting and preventing the full extent of damage.
Hence, there is a critical need for innovative solutions that leverage advanced technologies to enhance predictive capabilities of earthquake damage.
In recent years, the frequency and intensity of earthquakes have posed a significant threat to urban infrastructure, causing substantial
economic losses and human suffering.

So, This business case study explores the development and implementation of an advanced earthquake damage prediction system aimed at mitigating the
impact of seismic events on buildings infrastructure in earthquake-prone regions. The primary objective of this business case is to propose the
development and deployment of an earthquake damage prediction system that utilizes six different types of machine learning algorithms including:
Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, XG-Boosting.

Benefit from this model: Improved Urban Planning, Enhanced Public Safety, Reduced Economic Losses caused by earthquakes.
